# E-Commerce-Backend
- E-Commerce Backend works to process requests made to the database and provide alterations to it.
- I started out by adding code to the server.js, connecting sequelize and running a .sync
- Afterwards I went into the models and filled them out according to the specifications in
bootcampspot.
- After the models were created I went to the index.js file in the models folder and set up the One-to-One connections between the models.
- Following this, I set up the routes in the api folder with little issue.
- Once I had all of the code in place, I ran mysql and set up the database, and then seeded it
with the npm run seed command.
- No issues there, so I proceeded to run node server. I got a couple of small errors but they were just syntax issues and after getting them fixed things ran correctly.
